    <<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Alex (Alexander) Ball. I’m 24 and I live on the Gold Coast in sunny Queensland. I was born in Cairns, Australia where I was born into an all-Australian born family of mostly Austrian and Slovenian descent. I finished High School in 2014 where I achieved my QCE and a Cert III in Fitness. I them moved down to the Gold Coast where I started studying a degree in Urban and Environmental Planning. After nine months I realised that Town Planning wasn’t for me, and so I left and joined the workforce. I am an avid sports fan and love both playing and refereeing Basketball where I have gone as far as refereeing some pre-season State League games. I also love the beach which I enjoy with my fiancé Katie and my dog Ralph.</p>
<p>My Interest in IT started at a very young age. When I was about 7 my Aunt and Uncle moved to town and I started spending a lot of time with them on weekends. My uncle used to buy broken PC’s and rebuild them and sell them or give them to friends and family. Watching him do this and eventually being allowed to help him do this really sparked an interest in all things IT. </p>
<p>My main Interest in IT is the distribution and storage of information using the internet and other systems. I love how the internet and access to computers etc can open so many doors and lead to all sorts of information that you otherwise would never have been able to access. I have very limited IT experience other than what I have picked up along the way in this journey called life. I am always open to learning new things and as such am always picking things up. I have basic-intermediate Word and Excel knowledge as well as General all around experience using Windows and Android based products. Because of this I have become the go to ‘IT guy’ in my workplace that everyone asks to fix/solve their problem before we call our actual IT department.</p>
<p>Because of this I decided to pursue a Career in IT. I have begun this journey by enrolling in this course to get my degree. I choose RMIT because of the access with it being an online course. I still plan on working full time throughout my degree so being able to access everything online will make this much easier for me.  </p>
