    <h1>My Project Idea</h1>
    <p>I am heavily involved in Refereeing and teaching others to referee Basketball. We currently have no type of personal development system. Most of our current education is based around the passing on of verbally learned knowledge and the gaining of experience on the court, as well as the very occasional theory session. I believe that there is an opportunity a platform to be developed where referees could go to access all of the knowledge and materials needed for them, but where they can also answer a minimum number of questions per week on different scenarios that can help them develop their knowledge of the game.</p>
    <p> This sort of project would be unique to my knowledge as there aren’t any platforms where you get all of this in one place. There are multiple platforms out there that offer rostering solutions, but I believe if you were to integrate something like them into a platform where you can also offer education and resources to officials there would be a massive benefit not only to the referees themselves but to the associations that they work at as there would be an increase in the quality of officiating of their games.</p>
    <p>This platform would offer multiple services to both the officials and associations as a whole that would use it. It would offer a rostering service to the associations. This would include being able to import their competition’s schedule and allocate referees to each game to ensure that they have all games covered. It would also include features to ensure that officials aren’t rostered onto multiple games at the same time and would also be able to prevent other conflicts such as officiating games where they have family playing or refereeing at the same time as other commitments such as playing or coaching. There would also be the option for the users to put in their availability so that the association will know what officials are available for what games. </p>
    <p>The next feature would be that it could be used as a repositor for information. Whatever the association wanted could be put in one place for the officials to access at will. This could be copies of the official rules, association bylaws or even copies of referee reviews. This would be a massive help to keep all their useful information in one place.</p>
    <p>Another feature of the platform would be to have customisable forms available for use. There are many different uses that these could be used for, whether they be Referee Reviews or Player/Coach reports or even basic feedback forms. There would be many different uses that would be a benefit for all referees and associations that would use the platform, and they would all be customisable for whatever their individual use may be.</p>
    <p>The next feature would be the one that would set this platform apart form others. Having built in education to game assignment platform would be of massive benefit to the officials and their association. The education would involve training videos as well as tests/quizzes and other tools that can be used to develop officials at all levels. There would be resources that came with the platform but there would also be the option for associations to upload their own Videos or exams if they wanted to personalise something for their own association’s needs. The use of exams could be implemented and integrated into the game assignment part of the platform. Associations could have choice of making their officials answer a certain amount for questions or watch a certain number of videos per week/month/season before they are able to be allocated towards games. This could become an annoyance to some so would be an optional feature for the association to choose from. This is just where I would want to start this project and as it is developed, I am sure that even more features would be explored and developed as the project progressed. </p>
    <p>This platform would be developed as a website to begin with. This would allow it to be accessed by the greatest number of officials and associations to begin with. Eventually once it is up and running and in a stable and useable state with all of the original features implemented, I would start to transition it to an app-based platform. This would allow additional features to be added over the course of the development. One such feature would be to allow the user to record video and take pictures using the app on their phone and edit/upload them directly to the platform for education purposes. The platform being an app would open up even more opportunities for growth and added features. However, it would create more issues with development process because if it were to transition to an app it would have be based on all platforms to still allow everyone to access it. This means that it would have to be available on both Apple and Android devices while still be able to be access as a webpage.</p>
    <p>This development would mean that developers would have to have a wide range of skills. They would first up need to have the knowledge and skills to create and maintain a website/server to run the original website including HTML, CSS and Java. This would involve developing the main webpage, as well setting up an account system for each user to log in. To keep up with the long-term plans of the project the developers would also need to learn how develop apps on both Android and Apple. Kotlin could potentially be used to make the Android version and Swift could be used to make Apple product. These skills are becoming more and more common, so it isn’t impossible for someone to already have these skills or to learn them in a reasonable amount of time. This would be the perfect project to learn as they develop it due to the long-term factor of it and the fact that it wouldn’t be a mainstream product due to the fact of the specialised area it is aimed at.</p>
    <p>If this project is successful, it would provide a ‘one stop shop’ for Basketball Officials and Associations to have their Administration, Development and Reporting all in the place whether they wanted to use a smart device or PC. It would improve the standard of refereeing within a association if were to be implemented properly which would increase the overall standard of games and the enjoyability of the games for their paying customers. This product could be funded by itself due to the fact that the associations can be charged for the use of the product. Overall, I feel like this is a reasonable project that could be achieved without having to have many years of experience or a massive team.</p>
